          <p className="App-intro-long">Originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, I've lived in the Bay Area since 1994.
             Four years ago, I left a career in sustainable agriculture to complete my bachelor's degree. 
             Until taking a beginning programming class in Python during my final semester at Laney Community College to satisfy a quantative requirement, I was on 
             track to major in Communication, which changed after learning how to code. After being accepted to 
             Mills College in Oakland, I took a leap and decided to major in Computer Science graduating in May 2017.

          <p className="App-intro-long">I’m passionate about the convergence of design, accessibility, and user experience; my professional goal is to work in a role that utilizes my skills in product design and development.
          I believe that everyone should have exceptional experiences with web and mobile technologies, and I'm especially inspired to build solutions that create equity in access and functionality. 
          Check out my work page! I have worked on a variety of projects as a developer and UX/UI designer. </p>
          
          <p className="App-intro-long">As of April 2018, I'm attending Hackbright Academy as a fellow in their software engineering program. Beginning June 22nd, I will be available for work; please get in touch via the mail icon below if you're interested in chatting about potential work opportunities!</p>
             
          <p className="App-intro-long">When I'm not working on projects or learning new technologies, I'm an avid chef, produce nerd, kombucha brewer, and sometime DJ for fundraising events at my daughter's school.</p>
